# Lab-01. Check whether a point is inside of a triangle or not?

A triangle is formed as an intersection of the following three lines:
$y = 2 \cdot x$; 
$y = 2$; 
$y = 6 - x$;

Your program should get coordinated (x, y) of a point and print `INSIDE`, if point is inside a triange (or belongs to it), or `OUTSIDE` otherwise.

Example #1:<br>
Input: `1 2`<br>
Output: `INSIDE`

Example #2:<br>
Input: `1 3`<br>
Output: `OUTSIDE`
