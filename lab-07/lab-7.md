# Lab-07

## Lab-07-1.
There is a 2D matrix from integers with `n` rows and `m` columns (not have to be equal). Transpose the matrix:
- with respect to main diagonal
- with respect to side diagonal

**Example**<br>
Input:
```
3 2

1 2
3 4
5 6
```

Output:
```
Transposed matrix w.r.t. main diagonal:
1 3 5 
2 4 6

Transposed matrix w.r.t. side diagonal:
6 4 2 
5 3 1
```

## Lab-07-2.
There is a 2D matrix from integers with `n` rows and `m` columns (not have to be equal). Sort the elements (ascending) belonged to diagonals parallel to the main diagonal.

**Example**<br>
Input:
```
3 3

4 5 6
1 2 3
7 8 9
```

Output:
```
2 3 6
1 4 5
7 8 9
```
