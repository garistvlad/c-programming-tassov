# C Programming Language. BMSTU, RK faculty, Tassov labs
Programming assignments for "C Programming" course (RK faculty) taught by Kirill Tassov from BMSTU.

### Short description

There is a nice guy, Tassov Kirill Leonidovich, who was my first lecturer in computer science. It was a great luck for me to find a list of the assignments which I've seen first time long time ago in ~2007. Thank you, Kirill Leonidovich, for your work and very-well structured course. It was a matter of honor to refresh some basic C syntax, solve some assignments and rememder your jokes. If you ever seen this, I wish you good health and all the best ever.
