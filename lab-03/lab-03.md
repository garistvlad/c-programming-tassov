# Lab-03

## Lab-03-01. Integral with predefined precision

There is a function f (please, implement any function by yourself) and a segment [a ,b]. Knowing the presision $\varepsilon$, calculate the area under curve and print it rounded up to three decomal places.

Example: $f\left(x\right) = x$<br>
Input: `0 10`<br>
Output: `50.000`


## Lab-03-02. Find an extremum of function using the "golden ratio" technique

There is a function f (please, implement any function by yourself) and a segment [a ,b]. Knowing the presision $\varepsilon$, find the minimum of this function and print it rounded up to three decimal places.

Example: $f\left(x\right) = x^{2}$<br>
Input: `-5 10`<br>
Output: `0.000`
