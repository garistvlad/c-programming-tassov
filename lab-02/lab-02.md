# Lab-02

## Lab-02.1
Calculate the sum of sequence
$$\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}\left(\frac{x + n}{n!}\right)$$
until the difference between neighbors $x_{n}$ and $x_{n + 1}$ will become less than $\varepsilon$.<br>
Your program should get float parameters $x$ and $\varepsilon$ from imput stream and returns the sum of sequence rounded up to 3 digits.

Example:<br>
Input: `1 0.001`<br>
Output: `4.437`

## Lab-02.2

For the function, described above, print a table of function values from an interval `[a, b]`.<br>
Your program should get left and right borders of an interval (a and b), epsilon and returns function values from this interval.
